    a callback is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and
               is executed after the completion of the operation in the outer function.



           Callbacks are often used for asynchronous operations like handling events, network requests, or timeouts. 
           Instead of waiting for the operation to complete, 
           JavaScript can move on to execute other code 
           and "call back" the function when the operation is finished.
