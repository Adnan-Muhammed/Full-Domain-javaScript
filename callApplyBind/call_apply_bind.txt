call(), apply(), and bind() are JavaScript methods used to borrow a function from one object and set its this context to another object.

call(): Invokes the function immediately, passing arguments individually.
apply(): Invokes the function immediately, passing arguments as an array.
bind(): Returns a new function with a specific this context, to be invoked later.
