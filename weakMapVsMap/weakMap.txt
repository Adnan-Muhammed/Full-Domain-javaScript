let weakMap = new WeakMap()


let key = {'key':"keyValue"}




weakMap.set(key,{'weakValue':'weakValue'})


key =null

console.log(weakMap.get(key));

in this case there is no variable referenced or point any structure to this object  {'weakValue':'weakValue'}  so its become    GC 'd  due to key become no longer referenced  is it
